# todolist

My super-duper handy to do list! 

Todo list app created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

Includes external CSS and Javascript files, DOM scripting and forms. 

Published on Netlify. 

The tasks entered in the input field are rendered as a list on the page by pressing the add button.

The content of the input field is checked for being blank, having identical three characters (as you would get from randomly pressing keys) as well as too short content.

Incorrect content in the input field causes an error message as well as a blinking red border around the input field.

The tasks can be marked as done by checking the checkbox.

Tasks can be removed from the list by pressing the delete button. The button is shown as a trashcan icon and changes colour on hover.

The tasks can be filtered using the buttons on the bottom all/unfinished.

The tasks in the list are stored in localstorage.

Nifty favicon of pencil and notepad added to page.
